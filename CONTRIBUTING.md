Welcome, ThinkUp contributor!

Filing Issues
=============

When you file a ticket in ThinkUp's issue tracker, help us help you. First, make sure the issue has not already been filed. If you have a question or comment, discuss it on [the community mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/thinkupapp) instead of filing a ticket.

Most tickets fall under one of three categories.

Bug report
----------

To report a bug, include:

* The exact steps to reproduce the problem
* Links to the problematic page and screenshots of what you're seeing
* The version of ThinkUp you're running
* Your web host and the PHP and MySQL version running on your web server
* The full text of the error, and the contents of your Apache logs (if it's a PHP error) and the contents of ThinkUp's crawler log (if it's a crawler error)

New insights
------------

Use this [New Insight Issue template](https://gist.github.com/ginatrapani/11303222) to provide complete details of how your new insight would work.

We're always on the lookout for new insight ideas! The more specific and detailed you can be about what a new insight could look like, the more likely it is we'll build it.

Other Feature requests
----------------------

If your issue is a feature request, rather than file an issue, propose it on [the community mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/thinkupapp) first. ThinkUp has been an active project for over five years now, so most feature requests have been discussed at one time or another.


Pull Requests
=============

We love pull requests. We welcome contributors of all levels. Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork the repo.

2. Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests, and it's great
to know that you have a clean slate: `php tests/all_tests.php`

3. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes
require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we need
a test!

4. Make the test pass.

5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.


At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on, if not
accept, pull requests within three business days. We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.
