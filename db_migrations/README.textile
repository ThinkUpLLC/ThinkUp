h1. ThinkTank Database Migrations

Some ThinkTank code changes require modifications to the ThinkTank database structure. Eventually an auto-update mechanism will make this obselete, but for now, when a commit requires a database schema change, you have to run the migration script listed here.

Each script name has a date and description that coincides with the commit that requires it.

If a commit message starts with <code>[DB MIGRATION REQ'D]</code>, after you pull the latest code files, you'll need to run the corresponding migration script on your ThinkTank database before you run the crawler or use the webapp. If you don't, you'll run into errors.

To run a migration script at the command line, substitute in your DB username and path to the ThinkTank files, and use this command:

<code>mysql -u yourusername -p thinktank < /path/to/thinktank/db_migrations/YYY_MM_DD_script-name.sql</code>

Alternately, if you have web-based access to your database, like via PHPMyAdmin, copy and paste the migration script into the SQL window and run it.

h2. Migration Script Assumptions

The scripts listed here assume you're using the ThinkTank default table prefix <code>tt_</code>. 

If you are not, manually modify the script to use your prefix or delete it entirely to match your setup before you run it (or else you'll get table not found errors).
