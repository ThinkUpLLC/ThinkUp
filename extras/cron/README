Cron handler script

This scripts handles crawler execution and log rotation (once a week)
As long as it is up to date it will be the only cron script you'll need for ThinkTank.

Last Update: 2010-04-22

Set up cron handler:
 copy config.sample to config
 edit config so the settings matches your installation
 point cronjob so it executes ./cron at least once an hour
