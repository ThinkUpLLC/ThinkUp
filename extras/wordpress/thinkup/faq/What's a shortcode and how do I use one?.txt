A shortcode is what's called a "tag" that you can use in blog posts to alter how text is displayed or to display things like emoticons or images. You may have used them before in forums to [b]bold[/b] or [i]italic[/i] your text.

In the ThinkUp WordPress plugin there are currently three shortcodes: thinkup_chronological_archive, thinkup_post_replies and thinkup_reply_count. To use them, simply add them in square brackets to a blog post, like so: [thinkup_chronological_archive]. This shortcode will print out an archive of all of your posts.

You can pass arguments to shortcodes and some of them will actually require you to in able to function correctly. Check out the Help section for a guide on how to get started.
