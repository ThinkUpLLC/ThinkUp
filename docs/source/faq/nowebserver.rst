I don't have a web server. How can I use ThinkUp?
=================================================

ThinkUp :doc:`requires a public web server </install/sysreqs>` to run.

If you don't have access to a web server, you can `run ThinkUp for free on PHPFog
<http://expertlabs.org/2011/12/php-fog-adds-free-thinkup-hosting.html>`_ or try
our `ThinkUp Launcher for Amazon EC2 <http://expertlabs.aaas.org/thinkup-launcher/>`_. Here's more information on
:doc:`ThinkUp hosting providers </install/hostingproviders>`.
