Service Users
=============

Once you set up a ThinkUp user account, to start gathering data from various social networks, you'll set up one or more
service users. A service user is a user account on a particular network. For example, a Twitter user, a
Facebook page, or a Facebook user profile are all service users.

Set Up Multiple Service Users
-----------------------------

A ThinkUp user can have multiple service users associated with it. For example, ThinkUp user aplusk@example.com
might have three service users set up: @aplusk on Twitter, @mrskutcher on Twitter, and the Ashton Kutcher
Facebook page.

TODO: write or link to instructions for adding a new Twitter or Facebook user here.
