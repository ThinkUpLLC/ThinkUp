Service Users
=============

Once you set up a ThinkUp user account, to start gathering data from various social networks, you'll set up one or more
service users. A service user is a user account on a particular network. For example, a Twitter user, a
Facebook page, or a Facebook user profile are all service users.

Set Up Multiple Service Users
-----------------------------

A ThinkUp user can have multiple service users associated with it. For example, ThinkUp user aplusk@example.com
might have three service users set up: @aplusk on Twitter, @mrskutcher on Twitter, and the Ashton Kutcher
Facebook page.

Adding A New Service User
-------------------------

You can add new service users to your ThinkUp account through a series of approved plugins that are included with your ThinkUp installation. To get started, click on "Settings" on the right side of ThinkUp's status bar. On the next page, click on the "Plugins" tab if it isn't already selected. Next, click on the plugin (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) of your choice to add a new service user.  See the links below for step-by-step instructions for each ThinkUp plugin.
