Beta 0.1 - 27 Sept 2010
=======================

This is the last "drop tables and reinstall" release. From now on, you
will be able to upgrade your database smoothly from version to
version.

The major difference between the last alpha and first beta is the UI
interface overhaul discussed here:

Otherwise, compared to the 0.008 alpha, beta 0.1 includes a very long
laundry list of bugfixes and updates. You can see the complete
changelog here:
