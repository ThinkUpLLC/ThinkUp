1.0.1 - 8 Feb 2012
==================

Primarily a bugfix and developer release:

*   Interface improvement: In user registration and installation forms, validate user password (and repeat entry) as the
    user types using JavaScript widget instead of expecting user to submit the form and wait to get told if the password
    is not strong or long enough

*   Security improvement: Make writable directory configurable in config.inc.php's datadir_path value for environments
    with stricter security settings like orchestra.io. Documentation:
    http://thinkupapp.com/docs/install/advancedconfig.html

*   Bugfix: Avoid "Cannot redeclare class OAuthException" fatal error in Twitter plugin

*   Bugfix: Fix Tweet button markup on post detail page which potentially broke page design

*   Bugfix: When saving plugin options using Internet Explorer 8, avoid "Please complete all required fields" error

*   Bugfix: Return the correct search results for posts and avoid Uncaught TypeError in Javascript console

*   Bugfix: Avoid fatal error "Argument 2 passed to OwnerInstanceMySQLDAO::doesOwnerHaveAccessToInstance must be an
    instance of Instance, null given" when a username has an apostrophe in it

*   Bugfix: In Post API requests, return links associated with posts, respect both originating network AND ThinkUp's
    user privacy setting, and don't return blank JSON for Facebook data requests

*   Bugfix: More accurately extract user mentions from tweet text

*   Bugfix: Detect and display application URL correctly when running on a non-standard port

*   Bugfix: Defensively avoid PHP Notice Undefined index/property errors during crawl in Facebook, Google+, and 
    GeoEncoder plugins

*   Bugfix: In Twitter plugin Who You Follow view, rename "Deadbeats" to "Quietest"

*   Bugfix: In Twitter plugin settings, suggest an app name that's more likely to be globally unique/server-specific,
    instead of just "ThinkUp"

*   Bugfix: Standardize date format on Group membership and Follower count Google charts to Jan 08 and Jan '12

*   Bugfix: Prevent some instances from never being crawled by setting crawl process to run on instances on a per-owner
    basis

*   Bugfix: Remove unused app_title value in config.inc.php and replace it with app_title_prefix, which can be set and
    is now consistently used across page titles and email notifications. For example, to name your ThinkUp installation
    "My Awesome ThinkUp", set app_title_prefix = "My Awesome ". By default, it is an empty string. Documentation:
    http://thinkupapp.com/docs/install/advancedconfig.html

*   Bugfix: In Twitter plugin's JSON parsing, use id_str rather than numeric type to avoid bad post ID's from getting
    inserted into DB. (This function is currently used only by the FSMI, not the Twitter crawler by default.)

*   Bugfix: In Twitter Realtime plugin, avoid timezone not set error

*   Developer tool: Plugin maker auto-stubs out all necessary plugin code. Documentation:
    http://thinkupapp.com/docs/contribute/developers/plugins/buildplugin.html

*   Developer improvement: Escape markup and JS in user info/error/success messages by default to avoid inadvertent bad
    injections & encourage restricting markup to view template

*   Developer improvement: During Twitter REST crawl, capture mentions in the tu_mentions table. This enables devs to
    stop using MySQL LIKE clause to search tu_posts for mentions in the future

*   Developer improvement: Speed up unit test run bogged down by looping DNS resolution connection to a nonexistent host
    in PDODAO test

*   Developer improvement: Explicitly cast SimpleXML elements to primitive types when parsing Twitter XML from API

*   Developer improvement: Don't assume the default database table prefix or working directory location in all unit
    tests

*   Developer improvement: Consolidate logic to generate app URL into a single function and removed redundant
    THINKUP_BASE_URL global variable

*   Developer improvement: Add ability to load extlib classes in Loader without using awkward require_once statement

*   Documentation: Fixed typos and broken links in user interface, added documentation, restyled documentation using
    Twitter Bootstrap
