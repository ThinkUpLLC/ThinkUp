ThinkUp Inspirations
====================

Many other platforms perform some of the same functions or provide some
of the same capabilities as ThinkUp; We should learn from their
examples, and also try to share back with them what we've discovered
about ideas that work. Here are some other projects to ponder:

-  `The Archivist <http://archivist.visitmix.com/>`_ A clean tweet
   archiving/analytics app from a few Microsofties; Lead dev Karsten
   offered up his experiences and learnings on the ThinkUp list, and
   there's a `nice
   history <http://visitmix.com/Writings?Tag=archivist>`_ of many of
   their decisions online. `This
   post <http://visitmix.com/LabNotes/The-Archivist-Architecture>`_, on
   how their architecture evolved, might be of particular interest.
-  `BackupMyTweets <http://backupmytweets.com/>`_ Hosted backup service;
   provides search. Premium option allows for saving searches, storing
   their results also.
-  `Chirpstory <http://chirpstory.com/>`_: Twitter-focused curation
   tool. Allows for arbitrary selection and ordering of the updates
   shown.
-  `Crowdbooster <https://crowdbooster.com/>`_: Tool for businesses to
   manage social media relationships with customers. Interesting
   dashboard, and a site that features copy like "You are a visionary
   who believes in the promise of social media marketing. You believe
   that relationships with customers are everything and that every
   business should be an active participant in the community both on and
   offline."
-  `Curated.by <http://www.curated.by/>`_: TechCrunch
   `says <http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/22/chirpstory-lets-you-filter-and-bundle-tweets-into-stories/>`_
   this is in a similar category, but it's tough to tell how it relates
   to Storify or Chirpstory.
-  `Exquisite Tweets <http://www.exquisitetweets.com/>`_: Paste in the
   URL from a single tweet in a conversation to get a one-page thread
   you can share or save.
-  `Greplin <http://greplin.com>`_: Stores and indexes a range of social
   media and collaboration services. 'Autocompletes' on your archive as
   you type a string into the search box. Appears to retain a 'moving
   window' of indexed data– free version is currently 200MB. For
   Twitter, archives your twitter stream (starting from the point of
   activation) as well as your own posts and DMs.
-  `Keepstream <http://keepstream.com>`_: An archive service which adds
   the concept of 'collections': "Keepstream is a social media curation
   tool that gathers all your favorite content in one place. We pull in
   content from multiple sources, including Facebook likes and Twitter
   retweets, and let users build 'collections' of social media content.
   Users control the presentation of their content, add their
   commentary, and embed these collections on a website or blog."
-  `Laterstars <http://laterstars.com/>`_ App built around the idea of
   "favoriting stuff for later". Interesting way of surfacing good
   stuff, that could work well with our new favorites capabilities.
-  `Memolane- currently in beta <http://beta.memolane.com>`_ Not
   dissimilar to Momento in terms of concept, but a web service– keeps a
   day-by-day record of what you've posted to various services. Allows
   different privacy levels.
-  `Momento <http://momentoapp.com/>`_: An iOS (iPhone-optimized) app
   built around a journal concept, which begins by importing Twitter,
   Facebook, Vimeo, Foursquare, Gowalla, YouTube, and many more services
   to provide a view of your personal history. Very cleanly optimized
   for those who want to explore their own past actions/conversations in
   a beautiful UI.
-  `ReSearch.ly <http://research.ly/>`_ Paid platform, allows search of
   "1,000 days of Twitter data". From TC: "ReSearch.ly is essentially a
   high-powered Twitter search and analytics platform that allows users
   drill down by keyword, demographic, location, and more. ReSearch.ly
   also sorts Tweets by sentiment, and by community (i.e. Mommy
   Bloggers, Reporters)."
-  `Socialware Sync <http://sync.socialware.com/>`_ Another archiving
   app.
-  `Storify <http://storify.com/>`_ Storify is optimized for curating
   Twitter threads in a publishing context. In their words, "Storify is
   a way to tell stories using social media such as Tweets, photos and
   videos. You search multiple social networks from one place, and then
   drag individual elements into your story. You can re-order the
   elements and also add text to give context to your readers."
-  `Summify <http://summify.com>`_ (and `news.me <http://news.me>`_,
   which just launched) suggest things to read based on finding clusters
   of posted links from the people you follow. I (Amy) am finding this
   amazingly useful. I would love to build a plugin that did this.
-  `SwiftRiver <http://swiftly.org/overview/about-3/>`_: Open source app
   provides news filtering and analysis. "Enables the filtering and
   verification of real-time data from channels such as Twitter, SMS,
   Email and RSS feeds. This free tool is especially useful for
   organizations who need to sort their data by authority and accuracy,
   as opposed to popularity."
-  `Trunk.ly <http://trunk.ly/about/>`_: "By connecting into your social
   networks, Trunk.ly monitors and collects the links that you find
   interesting across the social web." E.g. for Twitter, "We extract all
   links from your tweets, retweets and tweets you favourite." Collects
   shared Facebook and Delicious links as well.
-  Twapper Keeper
   (`open-source <http://code.google.com/p/yourtwapperkeeper/>`_/`hosted <http://twapperkeeper.com/>`_):
   Allows for archives to be created based on #hashtag, @person, or
   keywords, and also collections of archives.
-  `TweeQL <https://github.com/marcua/tweeql>`_: Performs roughly like
   an SQL for the Twitter API. Python-based, includes sentiment
   analysis.
-  `TweetNest <http://pongsocket.com/tweetnest/>`_: Very cool PHP/MySQL
   tweet archiving app. Has a beautiful UI and visualizations, but not
   trying to do multiple networks, etc. as ThinkUp does. It may make
   sense to collaborate with them on a JSON representation of tweets so
   that both platforms can use the same visualizations, etc.
-  `Twitoaster <http://twitoaster.com/>`_ Twitoaster is a hosted service
   offering a fairly nice presentation of almost exactly ThinkUp's
   conversation view, though of course they've got ads on it too. Oddly,
   they seem to rank pretty well in Google for a lot of conversations,
   but we should look for at least reaching parity with what they've
   got.
-  `Twitalyzer <http://twitalyzer.com/>`_: Twitter analytics (paid).
-  `Vox Event Analytics <http://sm.rutgers.edu/vox/event/?e=3>`_: A
   datamining/visual analytics research project out of Rutgers. E.g, the
   2010 SOTU is one such event they analyzed. More on `how it
   works <http://sm.rutgers.edu/vox/how-it-works/>`_. Also:
