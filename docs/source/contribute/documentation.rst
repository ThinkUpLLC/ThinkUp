Not only does the ThinkUp community want to create a great software platform, we want to make it accessible to everyone
with clear and thorough documentation. You're reading the very beginning of that effort, but we've got
a lot of work to do.

If you're a ThinkUp user and know how to write clear descriptions and tutorials on technical topics, we need your help.

How to Contribute Documentation
-------------------------------

We write documentation in plain text files using a format called reStructuredText (RST). We store those source files
in `ThinkUp source code repository's docs folder <https://github.com/ginatrapani/ThinkUp/tree/master/docs/source>`_.
Then, the HTML pages you are reading right now are generated by a tool called `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_. To 
see what the RST source of this page looks like, navigate to the 
`file hosted on GitHub <https://github.com/ginatrapani/ThinkUp/blob/master/docs/source/contribute/documentation.rst>`_ 
and click on the "Raw" button at the top of the file.

To contribute new documentation, :doc:`fork ThinkUp's source code and issue a pull request for your changes
</contribute/developers/devfromsource>`.

Alternately, edit an existing page without leaving your browser using `GitHub's new "Fork and edit this file"
feature <https://github.com/blog/844-forking-with-the-edit-button>`_.

.. seealso::
    The `reStructuredText primer <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html>`_ is a good reference while you write rST. Also,
    this `reStructuredText online editor <http://rst.ninjs.org/>`_ lets you preview your work live on the web.

If you're not comfortable using Git but want to contribute documentation, author your pages in `ThinkUp's Community
Wiki <https://github.com/ginatrapani/ThinkUp/wiki>`_ and then email them to the ThinkUp community mailing list for review
and inclusion in this documentation.

We want to make contributing documentation as easy as possible. :doc:`Get in touch </contact>` with your ideas.
