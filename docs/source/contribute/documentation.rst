Documentation Writers
======================

.. admonition:: Help Wanted

    Currently we are porting ThinkUp's documentation from the `GitHub wiki 
    <https://github.com/ginatrapani/ThinkUp/wiki>`_ into the main repository. Please help with this tedious and 
    time-consuming effort.

Not only does the ThinkUp community want to create a great software platform, we want to make it accessible to everyone
with clear and thorough documentation. You're reading the very beginning of that effort, but we've got
a lot of work to do.

If you're a ThinkUp user and know how to write clear descriptions and tutorials on technical topics, we need your help.

How to Contribute Documentation
-------------------------------

This documentation is generated by a tool called `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_.  We write documentation in 
plain text files using a format called reStructuredText. We store those source files in `ThinkUp source code
repository's docs folder <https://github.com/ginatrapani/ThinkUp/tree/master/docs/source>`_. 

To contribute new documentation, :doc:`fork ThinkUp's source code and issue a pull request for your changes
</contribute/developers/devfromsource>`.
Alternately, edit an existing page without leaving your browser using `GitHub's new "Fork and edit this file"
feature <https://github.com/blog/844-forking-with-the-edit-button>`_.

.. seealso::
    The `reStructuredText primer <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html>`_ is a good reference while you write rST. Also,
    this `reStructuredText online editor <http://rst.ninjs.org/>`_ lets you preview your work live on the web.

We want to make contributing documentation as easy as possible. :doc:`Get in touch </contact>` with your ideas.
