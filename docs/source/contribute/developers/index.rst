Developer
=========

Welcome, developer! So glad you're here. ThinkUp is one of the most fun, new open source projects you could spend
your time hacking on. ThinkUp is written in PHP with a MySQL datastore by default, with plenty of JavaScript, CSS, and
HTML thrown in via Smarty templates. We do test-driven development here, as well as document-driven development, so get
ready to write your tests and docs first.
