Insight Style Guide
===================

As with all style guides, rules are made to be broken. That said, these are the rules most ThinkUp insights should follow.

Headlines
---------

-  **Punctuation:** Headlines should not end with punctuation.

  -  Yes: Adam Pash's road to 150,000 friends
  -  No: Adam Pash's road to 150,000 friends.

-  **Capitalization:** Headlines should be written in sentence case.

  -  Yes: It's a new 7-day high
  -  No: It's a New 7-day High

-  **Content:**

  -  **Make it personal:** Whenever possible, include specific information from the insight in the headline — in particular, the names of friends/followers, interesting numbers, etc.

     -  Yes: A big retweet for %other\_user
     -  No: You deliver a big retweet

  -  **Be brief:** Insights are short as is — don't try to shoehorn the entire insight in the headline. The headline should draw interest — it's the appetizer; the body is the main course.

-  **Sentence structure:** The headline should be a simple sentence or fragment.

  -  Simple sentence examples:

     -  it's a new 30-day high!
     -  %other\_user lends a hand
     -  %total links you %liked
     -  you've got a new verified follower!
     -  %other\_user thinks you're likeable

  Fragments should likewise be brief, often with an implied subject/verb along the lines of "it's" or "you've got".

  -  Examples:

     -  a friendly boost for %other\_user
     -  a congrats-worthy %post
     -  your %total-month-old profile
     -  an old favorite from %other\_user

-  **Length:** Headlines should be, at most, 100 characters. More often than not, they will be much shorter than this.

-  **Refer to the user, not her posts**: Avoid referring to things like "tweets" and "status updates" in headlines. It distances the user from the thing we’re discussing, but at its heart, the posts are a proxy to you, and people are reacting to *you*, not just your tweets.

  -  Yes: %other\_user thinks you're likeable
  -  No : %other\_user thinks your %posts are likeable

-  **Second person:** When using forms of “you” in headlines, remember that “you” will also need to be replaced by a username, so be conscious of that replacement, especially related to verbs. Here are translations that work:

  -  you => %user
  -  your => %user’s
  -  you’re => %user is
  -  you’ve => %user has
  -  you’ll => %user will

  Always keep an eye out for instances where the second-to-third-person translation will not work. E.g.:

  -  you do a good job => %user do a good job

Body
----

-  **Be complete:** The body of the insight should stand on its own. It should not refer to information that's only available in the headline.

  -  Yes:

     -  Headline: **It's been a big week in tweets**
     -  Body: %username tweeted over 40 times last week. That's 12 more
        than the prior week.

  -  No:

     -  Headline: **%username had 12 tweets over the past week**
     -  Body: That's 1 more tweet than the prior week.

-  **Be active:** Use active, rather than passive, language.

  -  Yes: %user resonated with women
  -  No: %user got the most reaction from women
