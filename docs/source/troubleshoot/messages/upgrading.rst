ThinkUp is currently in the process of upgrading
================================================

When you visit a ThinkUp installation and you see the message, "ThinkUp is currently in the process of upgrading.
Please try back again in a little while." that means that ThinkUp administrators need to complete the upgrade process.

If you are that installation's administrator: check your email.
---------------------------------------------------------------

A message with a link to complete the upgrade process should be in your inbox.

If your ThinkUp server's email function doesn't work, do the following:

Open the ``_lib/view/compiled_view/.htupgrade_token`` on your web server and copy the upgrade token to your clipboard.

Then, enter the upgrade token into ThinkUp's form and click on the "Submit Token" button to continue the upgrade
process.
