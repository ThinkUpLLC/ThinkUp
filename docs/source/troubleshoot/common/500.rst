Crawler constantly encounters Twitter API errors (ERROR 502)
============================================================

Twitter's API serves a lot of "fail whales", or HTTP errors. Every time ThinkUp encounters one, you will see it listed
in red in your crawler log. By default, the ThinkUp crawler will give up after receiving 5 error responses from
Twitter.com. To increase the number of errors ThinkUp tolerates, in the Twitter plugin's advanced options area,
increase the number to something higher (like 50).
