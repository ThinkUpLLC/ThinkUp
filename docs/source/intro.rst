    We're an open source community of developers, writers, designers, bloggers, journalists, data nerds,
    and social media enthusiasts whose goal is to make meaningful software with world-class documentation.
    
    You're reading the very beginning of that effort. This documentation is an incomplete, work-in-progress. Please 
    join us and help :doc:`fill in the gaps </contribute/documentation>`.

`ThinkUp <http://thinkup.com>`_ is a free, open source web application that captures your posts, tweets, replies,
retweets, friends, followers and links on social networks like Twitter and Facebook. With ThinkUp, you can store your
social activity in a database that YOU control, making it easy to search, sort, analyze, publish and display activity
from your network. All you need is a web server that can run a PHP application.

`Gina Trapani <http://ginatrapani.org>`_ began building ThinkUp as a personal project in 2009. From 2010 until 2012,
`Expert Labs <http://expertlabs.org>`_ incubated ThinkUp. Today, ThinkUp LLC, a company founded by Anil Dash and
Gina Trapani, leads development on the project.

At its heart, ThinkUp is a conversation analysis tool. ThinkUp helps you pose questions to your followers on social
networks, and compile and share the responses, whether you're The White House asking U.S. citizens what our country's
next Grand Challenge should be, or a writer asking what the best brand of ballpoint pen is.

ThinkUp also helps you answer questions about your social media activity, like "Who are my most popular followers?" and
"How many people saw a retweet of this tweet?"

Using ThinkUp, you can:

**Analyze:** Get insightful graphs and charts in a single simple dashboard which helps you make sense of your social
network activity.

**Search:** Ever get frustrated that Twitter doesn't let you find a tweet you posted a year ago? ThinkUp archives
all your tweets from the time you start running it, plus all its replies and retweets, and makes them available to
search and export.

**Visualize:** ThinkUp's rich visualizations let you see your conversations mapped across the globe, or as a collection
of most-frequently mentioned keywords.

**Publish:** ThinkUp lets you publish and embed conversations on a blog or website. Everyone can benefit from the wisdom
of your social network.

**Export:** Export your tweets at any time and open them as a spreadsheet in Excel for further analysis. Or just save
them for recordkeeping.
