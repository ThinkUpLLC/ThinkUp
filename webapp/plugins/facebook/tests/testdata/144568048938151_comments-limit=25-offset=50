         "message": "Studious Student II\n\nYou've decided to make up another string manipulation game instead of paying attention in class. Starting with a string composed entirely of 'a' and 'b' characters, you will iteratively apply the following operation:\n\nFor a string s of length len, choose indices i and j, where i \u003c j \u003c len. Choose a character c that occurs in the substring which begins at zero-based index i of string s and extends to the index j (inclusive). Replace all characters in s with zero-based index in [i, j] with a single instance of c to generate s'. Set s to be s'.\n\nAs an example of sequence of operations consider the string 'abba'. Some of the possible transformations are shown below. The substring being replaced is enclosed in square brackets.\n\n   1. [abb]a \u2192 [aa] \u2192 a\n   2. a[bba] \u2192 [aa] \u2192 a\n   3. ab[ba] \u2192 [abb] \u2192 a\n   4. a[bb]a \u2192 aba\n\nThe goal of your game is simple: calculate how many different sequences of operations you can perform. As this number can be very large, you decide to calculate it modulo 1,000,000,007. Two sequences of operations are considered different if they differ in length, or if they differ in at least one position. Note that the order of operations is a factor. The empty sequence of operations should be counted as well. Operations can be considered triples of (i, j, c) as described above, and these are the only values used when computing whether two operations are the same.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input file contains a single number N, the number of test cases. Each test case is written on a separate line, and contains a string consisting of letters 'a' and 'b'.\nOutput\n\nOutput N lines, with the answer to each test case on a single line.\nConstraints\n\nN = 20\n1 \u2264 len \u2264 60\ns only contains the lowercase characters 'a' and 'b'.\n\nExample input\n\n5\nab\naba\naabb\nababa\nbbbbb\nExample output\n3\n13\n57\n642\n120",

         "message": "Bonus Assignments\n\nYou are in charge of a group of N workers, and you want to pay a one-time bonus to each of them. The bonus for each worker is an integer number of dollars. According to state law the bonus of the worker who gets the least should be no less than A, but no more than B. To motivate your staff, the bonus of the worker who gets the most should be no less than C and no more than D.\n\nWorkers tend to spend their entire bonuses on HackerCola. Each of them buys bottles of HackerCola until he runs out of money, i.e., until amount of money left is less than the price of one bottle. Workers are very individualistic and each of them uses his own money only, so they never pool to buy HackerCola. Unfortunately you don't remember the price of one bottle of HackerCola, but you are pretty sure that it is an integer number of dollars greater than 1.\n\nSince you care about the working class you want to assign bonuses to workers in such a way that there would be at least one worker who would have some money left after buying as much HackerCola as possible regardless of the price of the bottle. Calculate the number of possible bonus assignments that fit this constraint. Two bonus assignments are different if at least one worker gets different bonus in each assignment. Since the answer can be large, calculate it modulo 1,000,000,007.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer T, the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines consists of 5 integers separated by spaces: N, A, B, C and D.\nOutput\n\nFor each of the test cases print a line containing number of possible bonus assignments modulo 1,000,000,007.\nConstraints\n\nT = 20\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^6\n1 \u2264 A \u2264 B \u2264 10^6\n1 \u2264 C \u2264 D \u2264 10^6\n\nExample input\n5\n2 1 2 4 5\n2 2 4 3 5\n1 5 10 5 10\n5 5 7 2 3\n5 2 7 5 12\nExample output\n6\n10\n0\n0\n149190",
