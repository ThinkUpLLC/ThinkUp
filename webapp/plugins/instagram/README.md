Instagram ThinkUp Plugin
=========================

The Instagram ThinkUp plugin retrieves media from Instagram users.

Installation
------------

For installation instructions, see the Instagram plugin configuration page, while logged in as an admin:

    http://yourserver.com/path-to-thinkup-webapp/account/?p=instagram

Use the same page to authorize the Instagram account(s) ThinkUp should crawl: click the **Connect with Instagram** button first, then use the link beneath it to grant ThinkUp offline access.

Crawler Plugin
--------------

During the crawl process, the Instagram plugin retrieves media on user profiles and inserts them and their comments into the ThinkUp database.
